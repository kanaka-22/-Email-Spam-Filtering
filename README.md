# -Email-Spam-Filtering
Use a dataset of emails and build a model that can identify spam emails.
Email messaging has become an integral part of our daily lives. You've probably noticed some strange emails landing in your junk or spam folder. Many email clients, such as Gmail, use machine learning alongside other techniques to detect and filter out spam emails. Once identified, these emails are redirected to the Junk folder.

In this guide, we'll learn how to build a spam email detection system using machine learning. We'll train our model on a dataset containing examples of spam content. Leveraging the powerful SciKit Learn library, we'll apply machine learning algorithms to categorize incoming emails as either spam or genuine.
